# CardioPredict
A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease using patient health data. This project leverages various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify whether a person is at risk of heart disease.
